# Chicago_Tires
This is an inventory system for a local tire and auto-repair shop
in my hometown of Iowa City, IA. The business is called Chicago Used and New Tires LLC. They
offer competitive prices for great used tires that are like new. 

From the end-user's perspective, this is a standalone desktop application that can be 
run on any machine. All you would need to do is compile the source code to .exe or .dmg to run it on Windows OS or MacOS respectively.
From the developer's perspective, the code base is written in Java. The Swing design framework was also implemented to layout and design the GUI frames.
To store the tire inventory, the system leverages the SQLITE database via the JDBC API. 

The business is now using the system to keep track of their new tire quantity. It's helping the owner know when to buy tires and which tires he needs more of.

PS: The University of Iowa news source, Iowa Now, wrote an article on this system. [Check it out!](https://stories.uiowa.edu/spring-2021-graduates-elhadi-elhadi)
